# KCNA Practice
This folder contains my personal notes from the KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate) 

I orginally planned to take the CKA earlier this year but decided I needed to work on the most important part first. 

The fundamentals - which is why I have included KCNA within this repo.

This section summarizes my preparation for the **Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)** certification.

While the official practice questions and materials used for study are not included here (copyrighted sources), this folder documents:
- Core Kubernetes concepts reviewed (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.)
- Study notes, analogies, and explanations written in my own words
- Key takeaways from official CNCF and Kubernetes documentation
- Self-made flashcards and mock question summaries
