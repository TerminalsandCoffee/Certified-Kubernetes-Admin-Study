# KCNA Practice
This folder contains my personal notes from the KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate) 

I orginally planned to take the CKA earlier this year but decided I needed to work on the most important part first. 

The fundamentals - which is why I have included KCNA within this repo.

I used two main materials to prepare. Udemy has a course and practice test by James Spurin, and the second is a book called, "Becoming KCNA Certified" by Dmitry Galkin. I am not associated by either course or book but feel free to review them on your own:

https://udemy.com/course/dive-into-cloud-native-containers-kubernetes-and-the-kcna/

I'll also add some content that can help you prepare for the **Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)** exam â€” focused on building hands-on understanding through projects, terminology summaries, and practice questions.

Each section reflects my own notes, explanations, and examples derived from official CNCF and Kubernetes documentation.
